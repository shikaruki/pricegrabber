It is a web app which helps user to compare the prices of different product available at e-commerce websites in a single window. 
It will fetch all related data from the flipkart, amazon and shopclues. 
Price drop alert will also be generated for one or more products to the user's mail whenever the price gets reduced on the respective e-commerce website.
In this project, we implemented the web-scrapping concept and Amazon API for the purpose of fetching the data using python(django).
